## Requirements

- node.js v7.10.0+ (7.10.0 is the version I used to develop this module.  I'm
  unsure if it will work with previous ones.  If you run a previous version, and
  it works, let me know and I'll update this)
- [memcached](https://github.com/3rd-Eden/memcached) 2.2.2+


## Contributions

If you run into problems, have questions, or whatever else you can open an
issue on this repository. If you'd like to submit
a patch, shoot me a pull request.  I'd like to keep this module simple, so if
you want to add all kinds of crazy functionality - you might want to fork.
When in doubt, send a pull request - the worst that can happen is that I won't
merge it.
